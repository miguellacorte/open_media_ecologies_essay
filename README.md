# Open Media Ecologies: networks of adaptation. 

This repository presents Open Media Ecologies (OMEs) as a form of reference, reflection and ignition towards the development of new sustainable media structures in the anthropocene.

You are invited to contribute by submitting any additions and deletions to the defining essay or, ideally, to the "Composing participation" compilation; this section offers practical guides, tools, and methods for developing sustainable participatory structures and nurturing open media ecologies

## **Defining Open Media ecologies**

An **Open Media Ecology (OME)** refers to any form of culture that has been deliberately conceived to enable and promote public participation within: 1. The creative process that defines the content of a specific media instance, as well as 2. The infrastructure responsible for its maintenance and distribution. 

In essence, an OME refers to any cultural structure which is actively conceived through Open creative processes within Open source distribution infrastructure:

- Open creative processes: All (or at least a considerable part of) the content, elements, and variables that define a media composition exist as open functions; The receiver is thus stimulated to engage in a sensory conversation that relies upon their unique conditioning and creative will [[1]](#1). The work’s range of possibilities is directly proportional to the public’s willingness to change these. This stands in contrast to a closed creative process, where media is actively conceived by a predefined composer and passively consumed by the public, which although is able to reinterpret the work, there is no active invitation for *recreation*, due to the medium’s impeding ability to interact with the defining elements of the composition (unless through an intervention e.g., sampling).
    
- Open source distribution infrastructure: all elements which structurally maintain the cultural experience are open source and thus open for public adaptation. The public has the opportunity and the responsibility to participate in shaping and modifying the distribution infrastructure. Within an open source media network, all individuals hold equal potential in determining all maintenance variables, for example: how information is shared, goals and policies are set, tax resources are allocated, programs are operated, and benefits such as contracts and patronage are distributed. In the case of individual works, open source distribution infrastructure ensure for free public accessibility of the work, independently from the revenue structure which the composer might choose upon. On collective projects, it is important to reiterate that the aim to hold for public adaptation processes must be sustained with the necessary infrastructure of participation (citar Castells). This tends to include: governance structure for consensus achievement, systems of mediation and conflict resolution, and perhaps above all, a strong set of values and core rules which establish an ethical working structure. It is here where the potential for open source distribution infrastructure is set; within carefully established maintenance and ethical structures the distribution system becomes and an adaptive entity able to respond and change to their immediate socio ecological environment (Citar P.A Gray).  OMEs thus propose an alternative  in comparison to modern closed media platforms which are often governed by economically-driven decisions and, institutions that are plagued by conflicts of interest due to their complex hierarchies and convoluted heritage systems.

## **Presenting Open Media Ecologies wihin the current culural landscape**

OME’s stand in contrast to the currently dominating culture industry [[3]] #3 or closed media ecologies [[4]] #4 which have been designed to prioritise (mostly through industrial methods) massively accessible experiences of commodified attention over intimate and nuanced experiences. In other terms, the industrial logic (citar lev manovich) from a closed media ecology defines the potential of public participation purely on a quantitative measure, thus omitting participation in a qualitative level. The economical nature of closed media ecologies has thus systematically converted the public receiving entity into an object of passivity rather than a subject of creation.  This has created a century-long deficient pattern where the public has become increasingly alienated from the the ethical responsibilities involved in the act of creation, and to a more damaging degree, society has created a deficient understanding of what and how we can create.  (citar brian eno)

Today, It should come to no surprise that as we face our current deficient cultural practices, so do we face the consequences of systematic extraction and control over our biological environments. Both issues stem from the same root; a generally flawed notion of creation as an activity that inherently exhorts control over its environments. We will not be able to reverse these issues until we fundamentally start to understand creation as an open and variable activity that is subject to change, as a system adaptable to the embedded chaos in nature.

Our modern society and its current cultural landscape demands now more than ever a new media ecology which isn’t based on control-seeking structures; we need new systems of distribution which aren’t inherently based on soliloquies over dialogues through systems of commodified attention that centralise and fix the creative process. 

The new media ecology (citar muriel cooper) is thus, one, where the trench between the artist and the audience is narrowed, and the creative process is shared and distributed. In turn, the public ignites a heightened sense of perception(citar moholy nagy) towards its environments and its involving ethical responsibilities, maintenance structures and labour systems commonly deceived in the creation of culture. Following the law of requisite variety, our potential for creation and imagination is directly proportional to the way we envision and treat our environments.

In a society where risk and uncertainty have become a economical product but also a prominent defining element of our modernity (citar risk society), OMEs presents itself as a structure that can systematically generate a new cultural attitude beyond the adversity of risk, thus trespassing the cultural limits implied by the industrial thinking structures (hacer cita/nota personal). The participative models which structurally define a OME are naturally bound to embrace risk and uncertainty (citar participation is risky). In other words, we are moving into an open model which actively invites the unknown person to the unknown experience, instead of inviting the unknown person to the known experience.

Being with the unknown is hence, being by surrendering, or rather, being by not controlling.

It is at this moment, that a culture of open creation is born. When the seeds of cultural surrendering begin to exist parallel to the seeds of cultural control, we can begin to harvest an open society.

Open media ecologies come with a heightened degree of responsibility. The potential for cultural development offered by OMEs is directly tied to assuming greater responsibility in media maintenance, addressing the basic needs of public participants, and ensuring the economic sustainability of freely available projects. Therefore, the question is not whether OMEs can exist, but rather: 

***How to design an open media ecology that effectively manages and maintains responsibilities collectively, considers the well-being of participants, and ensures the project's economic viability?***

As a form of example and test, this repository presents itself as a proto-open media ecology; It serves as a public collaborative space to explore and refine approaches that contribute to the growth and sustainability of open media ecologies. All contributions and participations are welcome by adding/editing/deleting within the “Composing Participation” section, or alternatively feel free to propose any change beyond the standard structure hereby presented.

9. agregar quote lev manovich: “ *The more likely reason why modern media has discrete levels is because it emerges during Industrial Revolution. In the nineteenth century, a new organization of production known as factory system gradually replaced artisan labor. It reached its classical form when Henry Ford installed first assembly line in his factory in 1913. The assembly line relied on two principles. The first was standardization of parts, already employed in the production of military uniform in the nineteenth century. The second, never principle, was the separation of the production process into a set of repetitive, sequential, and simple activities that could be executed by workers who did not have to master the entire process and could be easily replaced. Not surprisingly, modern media follows the factory logic, not only in terms of division of labor as witnessed in Hollywood film studios, animation studios or television production, but also on the level of its material organization.”*
