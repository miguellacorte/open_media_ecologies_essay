# Open Media Ecologies: networks of cultural adaptation. 

This repository presents Open Media Ecologies (OMEs) as a form of reference, reflection and ignition towards the development of new sustainable media structures in the anthropocene.

You are invited to contribute by submitting any additions and deletions to the defining essay or, ideally, to the "Composing participation" compilation; this section offers practical guides, tools, and methods for developing sustainable participatory structures and nurturing open media ecologies

## **Defining Open Media ecologies**

An **Open Media Ecology (OME)** refers to any form of culture that has been deliberately conceived to enable and promote public participation within: 1. The creative process that defines the content of a specific media instance, as well as 2. The infrastructure responsible for its maintenance and distribution. 

In essence, an OME refers to any cultural structure which is actively conceived through Open creative processes within Open source distribution infrastructure:

- Open creative processes: All (or at least a considerable part of) the content, elements, and variables that define a media composition exist as open functions; The receiver is thus stimulated to engage in a sensory conversation that relies upon their unique conditioning and creative will [[1]](#1). The work’s range of possibilities is directly proportional to the public’s willingness to change these. This stands in contrast to a closed creative process, where media is actively conceived by a predefined composer and passively consumed by the public, which although is able to reinterpret the work, there is no active invitation for *recreation*, due to the medium’s impeding ability to interact with the defining elements of the composition (unless through an intervention e.g., sampling).
    
- Open source distribution infrastructure: all elements which structurally maintain the cultural experience are open source[[2]](#2) and thus open for public adaptation. The public has the opportunity and responsibility[[3]](#3)[[4]](#4) to participate in shaping and modifying the distribution infrastructure. Within an open source media network, all individuals hold potential in determining all maintenance variables, for example: how information is shared, goals and policies are set, tax resources are allocated, programs are operated, and benefits such as contracts and patronage are distributed. In the case of individual works, open source distribution infrastructure ensures for free public accessibility and recreateability of the work, independently from the revenue structure which the composer might choose upon. On collective projects, it is important to reiterate that the aim to hold for public adaptation processes must be sustained with the necessary infrastructure of participation. This tends to include: governance structure for consensus achievement, systems of mediation and conflict resolution, and perhaps above all, a strong set of values and core rules which establish an ethical working structure. It is here where the potential for open source distribution infrastructure is set; within carefully established maintenance and ethical structures the distribution system becomes and an adaptive entity able to respond and change to their immediate socio ecological environment [[5]](#5)(Citar P.A Gray).  OMEs thus propose an alternative in comparison to modern closed media platforms which are often governed by economically-driven decisions and, institutions that are plagued by conflicts of interest due to their complex hierarchies and convoluted heritage systems.

Through the combination of open source distribution and open creative processes a new open cultural structure can be created where the value (economical, aesthethical or ethical) of the given distributed cultural item is inherently extended to the receiver, thus converting this entity also into a cultural capacitor which is able to produce and extend his potential of perception. [[6]](#6) 
It is thus of core importance for the integrity of the OME that these two qualities remain interdependent. Open creative processes without open source distribution infrastructure risks of acquisitve models which turn the participative potential of open creative processes into extractive products[[7]](#7). Parallel to this, a project with open source distribution without open creative processes risks of centralized value, similar to the web2.0 scheme[[8]](#8).   



## **Presenting Open Media Ecologies in the age of closed-control creative attention **

OME’s stand in contrast to the currently dominating culture industry [[4]](#4) or closed media ecologies [[5]](#5) which have been designed to prioritise (mostly through industrial methods) massively accessible experiences of commodified attention over intimate and nuanced experiences. In other terms, the industrial logic [[5]](#5)(citar lev manovich) from a closed media ecology defines the potential of public participation purely on a quantitative measure, thus omitting participation in a qualitative level. The economical nature of closed media ecologies has thus systematically converted the public receiving entity into an object of passivity rather than a subject of creation.  This has created a century-long deficient pattern where the public has become increasingly alienated from the the ethical responsibilities involved in the act of creation, and to a more damaging degree, society has created a deficient understanding of what and how we can create[[5]](#5).  (citar brian eno)

Today, It should come to no surprise that as we face our current deficient cultural practices, so do we face the consequences of systematic extraction and control over our biological environments. Both issues stem from the same root; a generally flawed notion of creation as an activity that inherently exhorts control over its environments. We will not be able to reverse these issues until we fundamentally start to understand creation as an open and variable activity that is subject to change, as a system adaptable to the embedded chaos in nature.

Our modern society and its current cultural landscape demands now more than ever a new media ecology which isn’t based on control-seeking structures; we need new systems of distribution which aren’t inherently based on soliloquies over dialogues through systems of commodified attention that centralise and fix the creative process. 

The new media ecology[[5]](#5) is thus, one, where the trench between the artist and the audience is narrowed, and the creative process is shared and distributed. In turn, the public ignites a heightened sense of perception[[5]](#5) towards its environments and its involving ethical responsibilities, maintenance structures and labour systems commonly deceived in the creation of culture. Following the law of requisite variety, our potential for creation and imagination is directly proportional to the way we envision and treat our environments.

In a society where risk and uncertainty have become a economical product but also a prominent defining element of our modernity[[5]](#5), OMEs presents itself as a structure that can systematically generate a new cultural attitude beyond the adversity of risk, thus trespassing the cultural limits implied by the industrial thinking structures. The participative models which structurally define a OME are naturally bound to embrace risk and uncertainty[[5]](#5). In other words, we are moving into an open model which actively invites the unknown person to the unknown experience, instead of inviting the unknown person to the known experience.

Being with the unknown is hence, being by surrendering, or rather, being by not controlling.

It is at this moment, that a culture of open creation is born. When the seeds of cultural surrendering begin to exist parallel to the seeds of cultural control, we can begin to harvest an open society.

Open media ecologies come with a heightened degree of responsibility. The potential for cultural development offered by OMEs is directly tied to assuming greater responsibility in media maintenance, addressing the basic needs of public participants, and ensuring the economic sustainability of freely available projects. Therefore, the question is not whether OMEs can exist, but rather: 

***How to design an open media ecology that effectively manages and maintains responsibilities collectively, while considering the well-being of participants and their involving socio-ecological environments?***

As a form of example and test, this repository presents itself as a proto-open media ecology; It serves as a public collaborative space to explore and refine approaches that contribute to the growth and sustainability of open media ecologies. All contributions and participations are welcome by adding/editing/deleting within the “Composing Participation” section, or alternatively feel free to propose any change beyond the standard structure hereby presented.

In this conference Castells points out that open source refers to a *“form of social organization of production”* that *“works as an open network of voluntary cooperation.”* He points out four challenges in the open source concept: (a) the motivation of the volunteers taking part in the process, (b) the economic logic that departs from conventional market logic, (c) the coordination of hundreds of volunteers without a hierarchical organization, and (d) the management of the complexity.

*"Free time is a mark of privilege, rather than an equal right. Instead of chasing an unrealistic concept of meritocracy, we should be striving for equity. Rather than thinking, "everyone can contribute to open source", we should be thinking, "everyone deserves the opportunity to contribute".*

*Time inequality contributes to a lack of diversity in Open Source
This fallacy of "free time" makes Open Source communities suffer from a lack of diversity. The demographics are even worse than the technology industry overall: while 22.6% of professional computer programmers in the workforce identify as women (Bureau of Labor Statistics), less than 5% of contributors do in Open Source (GitHub). And while 34% of programmers identify as ethnic or national minorities (Bureau of Labor Statistics), only 16% do in Open Source (GitHub)."*

Equal opportunity is a utopia within societies dominated by competitive markets; Following Castell's definition of common open source challenges in reference #3,adapting against meritocracy and creating systematic efforts for opportunities is a central problem to open source infratructure. Failure to achieve this can convert the open source infrastructure into its counterpart: a closed media ecology where decisions are centrally conceived.

*"Commercial software production is acquisitive in that firstly it acquires the labour of others, that is then sealed under employment contracts and copyright, and secondly demands that it is consumed as an acquisition whose disposition is similarly restricted. Copyright became significant to the emergence of commercial software as it is the application of copyright, used in its conventional restrictive sense, that is used to define the code as a fixed product. Free Software, in contrast, emphasises the code as something that enters into a continuum of production."*

Chapman & Hall. The Law of Requisite Variety states that in order for a control system to effectively manage and regulate a complex system, it must possess at least as much variety as the system it is trying to control. In other words, a system that seeks to govern or influence another system must be able to handle the same or greater amount of complexity and diversity that exists within the target system.

According to Ashby, if the regulating system has less variety than the system it is attempting to control, it will be overwhelmed and unable to effectively manage the system's behavior. Conversely, if the regulating system has greater variety than the system it is controlling, it will have the capacity to handle and adapt to the system's complexity.

 *The more likely reason why modern media has discrete levels is because it emerges during Industrial Revolution. In the nineteenth century, a new organization of production known as factory system gradually replaced artisan labor. It reached its classical form when Henry Ford installed first assembly line in his factory in 1913. The assembly line relied on two principles. The first was standardization of parts, already employed in the production of military uniform in the nineteenth century. The second, never principle, was the separation of the production process into a set of repetitive, sequential, and simple activities that could be executed by workers who did not have to master the entire process and could be easily replaced. Not surprisingly, modern media follows the factory logic, not only in terms of division of labor as witnessed in Hollywood film studios, animation studios or television production, but also on the level of its material organization.”*
